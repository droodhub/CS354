# CS354 - Machine Organization and Programming
This repository holds the project files from the 6 projects completed during CS354 at UW-Madison.\
Note that these projects used some files provided by the teacher to fully test the implementation, and this is only my code for the projects.\
Student_functions reads in a .csv file about popular movies and displays them in a formatted table\
Enigma_functions is an implementation of the Enigma machine from WWII. It takes a message and can encrypt and decrypt it as needed based on the current position of the 'rotors' of the machine.\
Linked_list is an implementation of the linked list data structure in C.\
Mem_functions is a memory allocator that attempts to allocate and free memory as requested by the program.\
To_Upper is an assembly version of a simple function that converts a string to uppercase.\
